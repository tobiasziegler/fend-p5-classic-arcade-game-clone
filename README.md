# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This JavaScript web app is inspired by the classic arcade game, Frogger.

The basic game engine and art assets were supplied by Udacity, and I've built
the game as part of the [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
